			"Through the thick smoke Davis could see two columns of enemy armor racing toward Wadi Al Sirree from the west. A battalion-sized unit of enemy tanks and armored infantry fighting vehicles was heading directly for him. The enemy was about eight hundred meters away and closing fast.",
			"Davis ducked down and hugged the bottom of his fighting posi- tion. The enemy artillery fire continued to pulverize BP Alamo. Fly- ing metal filled the air, whizzing past at high speed in a terrible tra- jectory of death.",
			"The enemy fire is extremely accurate. Too accurate! Davis thought. Either they have an observer nearby or they're using laser- guided artillery shells.",
			"\"Sir, I finally got through to battalion mortars,\" Cowper yelled. \"They're pulling back. The company has been shot to hell. They have enemy infantry all over the place. We're on our own.\"",
			"\"Enemy infantry?\" Davis questioned. A puzzled look streaked across his tired face. \"The bastards must have conducted an air as- sault in our rear! Why in the hell have they left us alone?\"",
			"The enemy artillery fire slackened. The dazed survivors of BP Alamo raised their heads to see the battlefield.",
			"\"Medic, medic!\" someone screamed.",
			"\"Fetterman is dead. So is Gerber,\" another voice shouted.",
			"\"Everybody check your weapons,\" Piper bellowed. \"The enemy will be here soon.\"",
			"\"Get those Javelins ready,\" Davis stood up and shouted to the Jav- elin gunners in the positions to the left and right. \"Don't fire until the enemy gets to the minefield!\"",
			"Two explosions detonated two hundred meters to their front. \"Take cover. Incoming!\" Cowper screamed.",
			"A single artillery round exploded directly on top of a position on the north edge of BP Alamo. The high-explosive shell disintegrated the position in a blast of fire and smoke. Davis fell over from the force of the blast. His ears were ringing so badly he could barely hear Private Cowper.",
			"\"Shit! They're going to take us out one at a time with artillery,\" Cowper cried, shaking with fear. \"We've got to get out of here!\""
