			"A 152mm artillery shell detonated yards away from Davis's position, showering it with steel, dirt, and rocks. Wadi Al Sirree was con- sumed by exploding artillery shells.",
			"My God, I can't breathe! Davis thought. We're finished!",
			"Davis's worst fears appeared to be coming true. The enemy was heading right for him. Pieces of deadly metal flew through the air. Geysers of dirt and stone billowed from the desert floor. Dust and smoke were everywhere.",
			"The devastating shock of the exploding shells crushed in around Davis's position. He gasped for breath as each new round seemed to suck the air from his lungs. His ears were ringing. He slowly picked himself up from the bottom of his position and rubbed the dirt from his mouth and nose.",
			"In spite of the flying steel, Davis struggled to see the battlefield. He looked over to Sergeant Mark's fighting position. It was his last futile act.",
			"A 152mm shell landed right on top of Davis's position. The explo- sion ripped his position apart like a pin puncturing a balloon, in- stantly killing the lieutenant and everyone near him.",
			"General Douglas MacArthur once said, \"That's the way it is in war. You win or lose, live or die-and the difference is just an eyelash.\"",
