			"After several moments Davis threw four smoke grenades to cover their move.",
			"The enemy armor kept advancing, firing as it came forward.",
			"\"Let's go. Everyone out!\" Davis ordered, shouting as loud as he could.",
			"Davis and Cowper crawled from their bunker and ran up the hill in short, quick rushes. Machine-gun bullets whizzed all around them. Sergeant Mark, the only survivor from his fighting position, jumped up and tried to follow Davis. A 30mm cannon round exploded to his left. The searing projectile cut him in half.",
			"Cowper was also hit in the back and fell over. Davis dove for cover. An enemy machine gun plastered the area where Cowper lay dying. Davis ducked behind the body of his RTO and checked the soldier for a pulse. Cowper was dead.",
			"Bullets from several enemy weapons sliced into the dirt in front of Davis, striking Cowper's body. At the same time one of the SAW gunners from 2d Squad rushed rearward to Davis's right, attempting to run away from the fire. The soldier moved three feet from his position before he was hit by an enemy machine-gun burst. The tear- ing bullets knocked him off his feet and threw his lifeless body to the ground as if he were a broken doll. No one else was moving. The only Americans Davis could see were already dead.",
			"The trail of green tracer machine-gun bullets marched toward Davis in small geysers of spurting sand. He raised his head to look for a way out. He never felt the round that struck him."
