# Arithmetic

## Cool men

People who you should know about, purely out of how supersized their brains are.
* [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler). You'll see his name come up a lot, everywhere.

## Cool stuff:

\(sin(x) / x\) & derivatives:
* Sum of inverted squares, aka [Basel Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem) ([?](https://mae.ufl.edu/~uhk/EULER-SINE.pdf)). The meat of the solution involves drawing connection toward the [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series), and applying a clever transformation from a generic property of polynomial equations.

Prime numbers:
* [Ulam's spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral), and its accompanying [Conjectures F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral#Hardy_and_Littlewood's_Conjecture_F). TLDR: There seems to be a pattern, which suggest a possiblity of standardized formula to generating prime numbers.
