### Current Russian-Ukraine War 
Fundamentally, the Russian had no choice if they want to live securely - Ukraine was an important march of it for the vast majority of its imperial existence, and unlike the Chinese they do not have the weight of 1+ billion populace to fall upon. Facing a larger and more resourceful alliance of US+NATO, with its population entering the same issue of decadence and declining core population, it has to make sure its allies function properly as buffer zone, or else.
See their concept of [Total War](https://simplicius76.substack.com/p/in-the-spirit-of-russian-total-war).

The true fighting started with 2014; but the seed of the conflict were sowed much earlier
- [CIA involvement in Ukraine](https://www.redstreetjournal.com/p/cia1?s=r) has started as early as 1950, supporting the infamous Stepan Bandera and his nationalist OUN branch in trying to destabilize the USSR, specifically in the Ukraine SSR.
- The main break between the two is 2014's Maidan protest, as part of CIA's Color Revolution - The encumbent Ukraine government was oursted by a popular coup instilled by pro-Western side. This causes essentially two retaliation acts from Russia: (1) Russian annexation of Crimea, of which the Russian Army immediately moved in and occupied Crimea, launched a ballot and annexed the territory into Russia (again); and (2) An uprising from the Donbass(Donetsk, Luhansk) territory which has the highest pro-Russian population and the most grievances with the change in government.
- Then the infamous SMO launched in 2022 and last until now. There are a lot of articles. Below are all that can be remembered:
    - _Rumor_ (?): allegedly the SMO was launch as a preemptive move - Ukraine was planning a large incursion to squash its rebels for good.
    - Battlemap in 2014-2022 showing that rebel Donetsk-Luhansk achieved most strength/influence in 2016 with (?) Airport, fighting under vastly inferior mechanized inventory and no hierachical OOB
    - Popular leader of the rebels (Givi, Motorola) were killed prior to 2022, and there are _rumor_ (?) that they are purged by Russian to easily consolidate the remaining forces.
    - After SMO launch, rebels elements of DPR/LPR into 1st Guard Army and 2nd Guard Army respectively.
    - 1st phase is when Russia launched a massive multi-vectored incursion across Ukraine, capturing large swathe of territory. This however didn't last, and by ~3 month later most of these occupation to North/Northeast of Ukraine were abandoned. Major events here included:
        - Fighting at [Hostomel Airport](?), with Russian VDV airdropping and occupy the airport for an unknown time. Russian source claim they occupied it until the retreat, while Ukraine source claim it re-took the airport around the 3rd days
        - A lot of units, mostly motorized battalions on BTRs was ambushed, famously during movement into Kiev(?)
        - Mariupol were encircled with trapped Azov units, which surrendered after some time 
        - During retreat, Ukraine claimed that the town of Bucha was massacred by Russian troops.
        - Russian tried to attack Ugledar with a column of tanks + APC which got basically wiped out.
        - Russian forces tried to attack through a river crossing with pontoon bridge + BMPs, also got wiped out.
    - 2nd phase is Russia consolidating its occupation and Ukraine attacking to reclaim territory.
        - Ukraine retook Kharkov with rather light casualty - Russian source claim they were conducting an orderly retreat, Ukraine source claim it took it fair and square. Later performance suggest the former.
        - Ukraine "counteroffensive" was launched with a lot of propaganda, utterly compromising OPSEC. This coupled with Russian superiority in artillery means a horrid disasters, with a lot of casualty and Western equipment burning
        - Ukraine's Patriot system stationed in Kiev was allegedly struck by Russian's hypersonic SCBM Kh-22 Kinzhal.
        - Russian steadily continued to push through the Donbass region
        - Prigozhin and his Wagner PMC seized Rostov-on-Don and demanded a change in the Russian cabinet. This fails, and a plane carrying him _mysteriously_ fell off the sky killing everybody on board.


Bottom line - do not believe in anybody's promise. Our nation's security must rely on itself.
