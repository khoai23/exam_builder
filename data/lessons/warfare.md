### WW2

One of the Werhmarcht general that is largely undervalued in media was Walter Model. It's clear that his Nazi membership was just the formality he needed to be where he wanted to be; and his capability to use ad-hoc elements to temporary stem disasters is second to none in the period. Maybe

Eastern front:
- A [good read](https://bigserge.substack.com/p/mechanized-stalinism) for not only post-Bagration ops but also how Warsaw Pact so easily formed in traditionally anti-Communist East. Also why Soviet watched Warsaw burn, they just got beat quite badly right next to the river.

### Current Russian-Ukraine War 
Fundamentally, the Russian had no choice if they want to live securely - Ukraine was an important march of it for the vast majority of its imperial existence, and unlike the Chinese they do not have the weight of 1+ billion populace to fall upon. Facing a larger and more resourceful alliance of US+NATO, with its population entering the same issue of decadence and declining core population, it has to make sure its allies function properly as buffer zone, or else.
See their concept of [Total War](https://simplicius76.substack.com/p/in-the-spirit-of-russian-total-war).

The true fighting started with 2014; but the seed of the conflict were sowed much earlier
- [CIA involvement in Ukraine](https://www.redstreetjournal.com/p/cia1?s=r) has started as early as 1950, supporting the infamous Stepan Bandera and his nationalist OUN branch in trying to destabilize the USSR, specifically in the Ukraine SSR.
- Following the dissolution of the USSR, Ukraine was given independence, although still kept a tense ties with its sibling. NATO continuously promise Ukraine cooperation and membership, of which Russia protested, threatened and ultimately preemptively resolved by forces.
    - In 2008, NATO already opened door for entry for Georgia and Ukraine, which Russia threatened that it will invade if they try to attempt so. Subsequently Ukraine parliament voted through a law to disallow itself from joining any military bloc; while Georgia, confident in NATO backing, invaded Abkhazia & South Ossetia and got invaded back by Russia.
    - The main break between the two is 2014's Maidan protest, as part of CIA's Color Revolution - The encumbent Ukraine government & pro-Russian president (Yanukovich)  was oursted by a popular coup instilled by pro-Western side.
        - Sniper fire broke out targetting both Maidan protesters and police, which is later revealed to be a [false flag](https://web.archive.org/web/20220428121407/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan-Katchanovski/publication/266855828_The_Snipers%27_Massacre_on_the_Maidan_in_Ukraine/links/5a83a7f7a6fdcc6f3eb295a5/The-Snipers-Massacre-on-the-Maidan-in-Ukraine.pdf?origin=publication_detail) triggering the full swing of the Maidan.
        - After seizing the government, the new parliament then vote on the billingual law enforcing Ukrainian as the sole national language, triggering anti-Maidan counter protests across the pro-Russian easts
        - Russian annexation of Crimea, of which the Russian Army immediately moved in and occupied Crimea, launched a ballot and annexed the territory into Russia (again). In response, the Ukraine parliament first dissolve the Crimean parliament and cut its water supply.
        - Odessa fires at the Trade Union house, in which pro-Maidan lit a fire in a building with a lot of pro-Russian protesters still inside, causing massive casualties.
        - An uprising from the Donbas(Donetsk, Luhansk) territory which has the highest pro-Russian population and the most grievances with the change in government. Subsequently, lacking necessary troops to counter this, Ukraine resorted to elevating and recruiting paramilitary militias that are precursor to many of the current iconic units (e.g Azov)
    - During the following period, Ukraine attempted to put down its rebels, while Russia attempted to intervene without contributing direct force.
        - First phase is when the rebel expanded as much of its hold as possible, with notable territorial gain in capturing Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Mariupol. Ukraine's 25th Airborne Brigade was disbanded during this period after repeatedly surrendering their equipment/ammunitions as they are surrounded with protesters.
        - Subsequently, Ukraine launched its ATO campaign which intensified after the declaration of the separatist governments signed an agreement that formed the new Novorossiya state. Separatist control were greatly reduced and many cities were recaptured by Ukrainian forces, such as Semenovka, Nikolaev, Kramatorsk, Bakhmut, Siversk, Soledar and Avdevka. Many of these names would come back later..
        - At the end of August, rebel leadership was given more covert support from Russia, and began its own campaign. DPR forces reached Mariupol but didn't manage to siege it as Minsk Protocol talk was underway. Regardless, continued hostility still continued, with the 2nd Battle of Donetsk Airport occuring during this period. Ukraine's PM confirmed that they lost [60-65%](https://web.archive.org/web/20220430030646/http://www.unn.com.ua/ru/news/1387749-na-peredoviy-bulo-znischeno-60-65-viyskovoyi-tekhniki-v-chastinakh-p-poroshenko) of their total active equipment during the full period of fighting.
        - Renewed hostility running through 2015 was tipped off at the Battle of Debaltsevo, at which separatist managed to encircled dug-in positions of Ukraine Armed Force by fire-control over its road toward nearby Artemovsk, and then by seizing Lohvyove to complete blocking the retreat route. Despite Minsk II being signed, separatist force continued to squeeze the trapped Ukraine force and force a route at the end of Feb.
        - 2016 to 2020 was a much-deserved lull, aside from sporadic fighting and back-and-forth accusations of broken truces, but for the most part both side refrained from launching any large incursion into opposing territory. Ukraine [amended its constitution](https://archive.ph/x1Gqv) in 2019, effectively shutting down any hope of Russia to influence the government peacefully.
        - 2021 however saw a ramp-up in hostility, with Agent Z issuing a decree to recapture Crimea, releasing a joint statement of US strategic partnership, and the capturing of Staromarovka by Ukraine force. 

    
- Then the infamous SMO launched in Feb 2022 and last until now. There are a lot of articles. Below are all that can be remembered:
    - Allegedly the SMO was launch as a [preemptive move](https://archive.ph/RN71w) - Ukraine was planning a large incursion to squash its rebels for good.
    - Popular leader of the rebels (Givi, Motorola) were killed prior to 2022, and there are _rumor_ (?) that they are purged by Russian to easily consolidate the remaining forces.
    - After SMO launch, rebels elements of DPR/LPR into 1st Guard Army and 2nd Guard Army respectively.
    - 1st phase is when Russia launched a massive multi-vectored incursion across Ukraine, capturing large swathe of territory. This however didn't last, and by ~3 month later most of these occupation to North/Northeast of Ukraine were abandoned. Major events here included:
        - Fighting at [Hostomel Airport](?), with Russian VDV airdropping and occupy the airport for an unknown time. Russian source claim they occupied it until the retreat, while Ukraine source claim it re-took the airport around the 3rd days
        - A lot of units, mostly motorized battalions on BTRs was ambushed, famously during movement into Kiev(?)
        - Mariupol were encircled with trapped Azov units, which surrendered after some time 
        - During retreat, Ukraine claimed that the town of Bucha was massacred by Russian troops.
        - Russian tried to attack Ugledar with a column of tanks + APC which got basically wiped out.
        - Russian forces tried to attack through a river crossing with pontoon bridge + BMPs, also got wiped out.
    - 2nd phase is Russia consolidating its occupation and Ukraine attacking to reclaim territory.
        - Ukraine retook Kharkov with rather light casualty - Russian source claim they were conducting an orderly retreat, Ukraine source claim it took it fair and square. Later performance suggest the former.
        - Zapzap NPP is being shelled; which Ukraine accuse Russian doing, which means.. Russian were shelling its own occupied 
        - Ukraine "counteroffensive" was launched with a lot of propaganda, utterly compromising OPSEC. This coupled with Russian superiority in artillery means a horrid disasters, with Western equipment burning and [lots of casualty](https://simplicius76.substack.com/p/sitrep-9423-first-challengers-burn). Not necessarily in that order. 
        - Ukraine's Patriot system stationed in Kiev was allegedly struck by Russian's hypersonic SCBM Kh-22 Kinzhal.
        - Russian steadily continued to push through the Donbas region; some important fortress-city continue to fall - Lysychansk, [Bakhmut](https://bigserge.substack.com/p/the-battle-of-bakhmut-postmortem)
        - Prigozhin and his Wagner PMC seized Rostov-on-Don and demanded a change in the Russian cabinet. This fails, and a plane carrying him _mysteriously_ fell off the sky killing everybody on board.
    - 3rd phase is currently happening, with allegedly overwhelmingly Russian overmatch of manpower and material on the Donbas front and Ukraine currently attempting another offensive.
        - Ukraine losing more fortified towns and cities as time progressed: [Avdevka](https://simplicius76.substack.com/p/battle-for-avdeevka-close-study), 
        - Ukraine launching an offensive at Kursk, capturing Sudha and making good headway in the 1st week; subsequent fighting suggesting that Ukraine were aiming for the NPP in the region or a PR victory, both essentially not achieved at the time of writing
        - Russian forces in Donbas reporting "unpredecented" success in taking territory; edging toward Provorsk, capturing Ukrainsk, almost completely encircled Ugledar, and more as Ukraine continue to pour effort into Kursk.

Bottom line - do not believe in anybody's promise. Our nation's security must rely on itself.

### Propaganda

I'm biased, so be careful.
That being said, it's rather obvious that the US and its puppets do best at _projection_. The rule of thumb is that anything heinous reported by the US or its allies is something __they__ did and then blame the other. Case in point:
    - Claiming [massive Russian casualties](https://www.moonofalabama.org/2023/03/ukraine-is-lying-about-casualty-ratios-to-justify-holding-of-bakhmut.html) and [attrition in their favor](https://simplicius76.substack.com/p/bombshell-report-claims-russian-casualties)
    - Russia is running out of [Shells](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-weapons-shells-european-union-eu-war-russia-investigation/33025300.html)/[Missiles](?)/[Air Defense](?)
    - So called "independent" counter has essentially inflated all kind of vehicle losses, as it conflicted directly with [Ukraine source](https://simplicius76.substack.com/p/more-afu-downers-from-the-press-mill)
    - Guess who violated truces and [shot surrendering soldiers](https://odysee.com/@Overthrown:6/x2mate_com-Combat_GoPro_of_Foreign_Fighter_Destroying_Russian_BMP-_1080p60__AdobeExpress:e) dead?
    - Bucha, Kramatorsk, etc. [here](https://peaceinitiative.substack.com/p/russia-did-it-narrative). Note that the source is clearly pro-Russian and so need cherry-picking (e.g MH17 was flying over war-heated Donbas, a Buk hitting it due to no IFF is a completely valid accident)


### Military Hardware

The biggest winner of the recent war has been drone - mass proliferation of cheap electronics and insufficient EW on both side mean drone are an ever-present tool for accurate strike comparable to conventional artillery, greatly limiting the strength of conventional armored/mechanized divisions.
That being said, a lot of things has come to light, namely how fundamentally screwed Western system are at a design level. Nevertheless, it's not all sunshine in the Russian side either - their lack of counterbattery, EW and integrated communication are serious and not necessarily been solved at the point of writing.
