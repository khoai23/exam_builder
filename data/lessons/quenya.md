# Quenya 

## Introduction

If you need proof about how authenticity is prime indicator of attraction, look no further than Tolkien. The madman literally invented several languages as a hobby, and invented an accompanying universe, stories & books for their fluff (context). Such secondary goals ended up being modern classic that not much else could come close.

Anyway. One of the language invented is [Quenya](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Quenya), which is Latin-equivalent in the Tolkien universe. It has some cool feature, chief of which is the agglutinative nature taken from Finnish - it's possible for a single word in Quenya to means an entire statement by itself; this somewhat mimic both Latin's [highly inflected language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_grammar), its laconism, and its gradual decline of usage (probably due to complexity).

##### {Tolkien} So, who spoke it?

###### Elves. Tolkien's Elves who came to ~~Heaven~~[Aman](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Vanyar) are split into 3 different "clan": [Vanyar](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Vanyar) & [Noldor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Noldor), who spoke Quenya; and [Teleri/Falmari](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Teleri), who spoke Telerin which is also intelligible with Quenya despite different roots.<br>Tolkien's Elves who remained in Middle Earth ([Nandor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Nandor)/[Sindar](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sindar)) has their own languages, of which Sindarin is most used.

##### {Latin} Highly inflected?

###### Like you wouldn't believe. In Latin, nouns are inflected for number (singular, plural), but also for case (is sentence subject, object, ownership, etc.) and usually belong to one of the three genders; Pronouns/Adjectives are inflected with matching nouns properties above; and verbs inflected the same plus tense (+ aspect), voice and mood. In order to learn Latin, you would need to know the words (in the case of noun, also know the gender/rule to infer gender), and know all the rules to properly inflect them into the context you need it in. This make a very compact language with flexible word order, but likely a hard-to-learn language; and all of its successor tend to lessen the amount of inflection needed.<br>For more information, go to [Latin](learn?key=latin).

##### {Lazy} I just want to spout some trendy phases..

##### [Here](https://www.realelvish.net/101_quenya.html). You are better off with something like Latin, or whatever obscure real language. If nobody understand you, they have every reason to suspect you saying nonsense.

{Plagiarised directly from tolkiengateway} 
Of the three clans of Elves in Aman, the Noldor and the Vanyar spoke slightly different, though mutually intelligible, dialects of Quenya (Valinorean Quenya and Vanyarin Quenya respectively). Following the Exile of the Noldor in the First Age, a third dialect, Exilic Quenya or Noldorin Quenya, developed among the Noldor who had journeyed to Middle-earth. In general practice, the word Quenya usually refers to Noldorin Quenya, since it was the only Quenya dialect spoken in Middle-earth.

The language was also adopted by the Valar who made some new introductions into it from their own language, though these loanwords are more numerous in the Vanyarin dialect than the Noldorin one. This is probably the case because of the enduringly close relationship the Vanyar had with the Valar. The third clan in Aman, the Teleri, spoke a different, closely related language: Telerin. This was by some seen as a dialect of Quenya which was untrue in a historic perspective but plausible in a linguistic one; the languages did not share a common history but were very much alike.

The Noldor who fled to Middle-earth following the Darkening of Valinor spoke Quenya among themselves. However, when Elu Thingol of Doriath, who was the king of the Sindar (Elves of the Telerin line who remained in Beleriand instead of journeying to Valinor) learnt about their slaying of the Teleri, he forbade the use of Quenya in all his realm. The Sindar had been slow to learn Quenya anyway, while the Noldor at this time had fully mastered Sindarin.

Noldorin Quenya (Exilic) differed somewhat from Valinorean Quenya, because the language continued to evolve after exile, and it underwent some regularisation as it became a language of lore. There were also a few changes in pronunciation.

The Quenya used in Middle-earth of the Third Age had come to be a scholarly pursuit; it was not typically used in conversation. It was preserved as a formal language and for writing; Sindarin was the vernacular of all Elves. However, the Noldor still remembered Quenya and valued it highly and were delighted when other wanderers knew anything from the "Ancient Speech"; for example, Gildor and his party appreciated Frodo Baggins's greeting *Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo* ("A star shines on the hour of our meeting"). Galadriel was perhaps the only known High Elf in Middle-earth during that time who (having being born in Valinor) had learned Quenya as a cradle-tongue.

The poem *Namárië* is the longest piece of Quenya found in The Lord of the Rings. It is also known as *Galadriel's Lament*.
