# LEGO Weapon sheet 

Hopefully we can find some way to categorize & find out what the hell was the real name of the M79 sheet.

Still haven't found:
* M79 Grenade Launcher 
* RPK/RPK-74

Resources:

* [BrickTactical](learn?key=bricktac)
* TODO [BrickArms](learn?key=brickarms)

Currently identified, list in order of favoritism & certainty in identification:
