# LEGO Weapon sheet

A "sheet" in this scenario is a pack of minifigure-compatible weapons stamped in a full plastic sheet.
Hopefully we can find some way to categorize & find a full catalog of things somewhere.

Still haven't found:
* ~~M79 Grenade Launcher~~
* RPK Variant
* ~~PKM~~
* STV (Galil ACE) clone to use on elite units

Resources:

* [BrickArms](learn?key=brickarms), US custom maker, high quality + authenticity
* [BrickTactical](learn?key=bricktac), Dunno who
* [MinifigCat](learn?key=minifigcat), Taiwan custom maker, high quality & variants, but not necessarily named correctly. Also weebs.

Currently identified, list in order of favoritism & certainty in identification:

### Full Sheets

1. [K7016](https://shopee.vn/%C4%90%E1%BB%93-Ch%C6%A1i-V%E1%BB%89-V%C5%A9-Kh%C3%AD-K7016-D%C3%B9ng-Trong-Th%E1%BA%BF-Chi%E1%BA%BFn-2-NO.340-Ph%E1%BB%A5-Ki%E1%BB%87n-MOC-Army-i.63856987.4753786961), trade in the mine clearing stuff for bugle + sword. Called K7016 [here](https://shopee.vn/V%E1%BB%89-ph%E1%BB%A5-ki%E1%BB%87n-v%C5%A9-kh%C3%AD-th%E1%BA%BF-chi%E1%BA%BFn-2-c%E1%BB%B1c-ch%E1%BA%A5t-%C4%90%E1%BB%93-ch%C6%A1i-L%E1%BA%AFp-gh%C3%A9p-X%E1%BA%BFp-h%C3%ACnh-Mini-Minifigures-l%C3%ADnh-Army-WW2-M%C3%B4-h%C3%ACnh-K7016-i.81322028.3720619582) too, so K1707 is too likely a misnomer.

2. K7028, Dunno what it is, but mostly breacher/cutter tools.
    1. [CQB RAM](learn?key=minifigcat#CQBRAM)
3. [K7029](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/k7029-lego-compatible-minifigure-accessories-i3356961709.html), Sniper Rifle Pack, looks like nobody buys since it's kinda wack. Nothing is properly identified, so not bothering to add ?. Is also marked as JX092 [here](https://shopee.vn/X%E1%BA%BFp-h%C3%ACnh-ph%E1%BB%A5-ki%E1%BB%87n-MOC-v%E1%BB%89-v%C5%A9-kh%C3%AD-qu%C3%A2n-s%E1%BB%B1-m%C3%A0u-%C4%91%E1%BB%8F-%C4%90%E1%BB%93-Ch%C6%A1i-L%E1%BA%AFp-Gh%C3%A9p-S%C3%A1ng-T%E1%BA%A1o-JX092-i.93677919.12289508837)
    1. AWM, only reliable due to how ubiquitous it is in CS
    7. QBU-88, tips: chinese guns will only has number since sellers just scrub chinese texts.
    2. [M14](learn?key=minifigcat#M14)
    3. [M110](learn?key=minifigcat#M110)
    4. ~~Something-G3~~ [G3GS1](learn?key=minifigcat#G3GS1)

    7. XM8
    8. Barrett (M82A1?) [M83](learn?key=minifigcat#M83)
4. K7030, Assault Rifle Pack, has some neat looking AK-74 stuff.
    1. 2 AK variants with underbarrel handler, ~~likely from BrickArms~~ can't even identify; scopes are ridiculous.
    2. QBZ-95
    3. ~~M16A3 (underslung shotgun?)~~ [M16-DBR](learn?key=brickarms#M16-DBR) or [M16SB](learn?key=minifigcat#M16SB)

    8. QBZ-03; could pass as an AK variant (cause it really is)
    9. Something-CQB, likely another M4/M16 variant. Best match is [Diplomat Rifle](learn?key=minifigcat#DiplomatRifle)
    10. P288 ([actually UCS?](learn?key=brickarms#UCS))
    11. [M23](learn?key=brickarms#M23)

    3. [SCAR-D](learn?key=minifigcat#SCARD)
    4. [MP5A2](learn?key=minifigcat#MP5A2)/[A3](learn?key=minifigcat#MP5A3)

    10. QCW-05
    11. [Longslide](learn?key=brickarms#Longslide)
    12. [TT-33](learn?key=brickarms#TT-33), ~~all the gun with vertical grooves at the back should be either this or UCS~~ Nevermind; too many handgun at minifigcat
6. **(Favorite)** K7032, Quasi Heavy Weapon Pack, altho is a bit US-centric. Has:
    1. **RPD**
    2. M60
    3. M249 (identifiable with barrel changing handler)
    4. MK46 aka M249-SPW 
    5. Milkor MGL-105. Not the Brickarms's [MGL](learn?key=brickarms#MGL) or RG-6 since the stock is different. Actually is [SGL10](learn?key=minifigcat#ShotgunSGL10) but honestly what the heck is that.
    6. M97 Trench Gun
    7. [Radi8 .44 RMR](learn?key=brickarms#Radi8.44RMR).
    8. [ACS](learn?key=brickarms#ACS), aka AA12 that nobody buys IRL
    9. Unidentified single-shot shotgun thingie

7. K7050, See **PK029** below as possible pack.
7. [K7051](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/k7051-lego-compatible-ww2-minifigure-accessories-i3283313831-s16592042154.html), WW2 Axis Pack. MG-34, MG-42, MP18-28, STG-44, MP-40 (with skeleton stock), Mauser, mashed potato grenade 
8. K7052, WW2 Rifle Pack. A bunch of M1, 98K, Springfield etc.

9. [K7061B](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/k7061b-lego-compatible-minifigure-accessories-i3357626122-s17100208820.html), Heavy-Sniper Pack.
    1. M249/M60 exactly like K7032
    2. Real BrickArms's [MGL](http://localhost:5000/learn?key=brickarms#MGL), evident by thicker stock
    2. AWM, G3, #8 similar to barrett, but likely the QBU-10 
    3. Unidentified drum mag LMG, probably AK-family. Best match is the [PKP Pecheneg](https://www.minifigures.co.uk/store/combatbrick-russian-pkp-pecheneg-machine-gun-dark-tan/) with the forced-cooling barrel, but that doesn't have drum mag. Could be a case of misputting magazine?
    4. QBZ-95 
10. [K7061A](https://shopee.vn/V%E1%BB%89-Ph%E1%BB%A5-ki%E1%BB%87n-trang-b%E1%BB%8B-v%C5%A9-kh%C3%AD-si%C3%AAu-ch%E1%BA%A5t-%C4%90%E1%BB%93-ch%C6%A1i-L%E1%BA%AFp-gh%C3%A9p-Mini-Minifigures-Army-l%C3%ADnh-M%C3%B4-h%C3%ACnh-ww2-K7061-i.81322028.18912343562?sp_atk=315e619e-4223-49ea-b09a-67822f1f16be&xptdk=315e619e-4223-49ea-b09a-67822f1f16be), RPG + Sniper Pack. Again, none of the rifle are identifiable.
    1. **RPG-7**
    2. M72-LAW 
    3. AA12 again, for some reason 
    4. M110, M134, M802, duplicate from K7029
    5. XM2010; which hold some resemblance to [PSG1](learn?key=minifigcat#PSG1), but nobody has that square stock
    6. ACE? [M103](learn?key=minifigcat#M103)
11. [K7064A](https://shopee.vn/V%E1%BB%89-Ph%E1%BB%A5-ki%E1%BB%87n-trang-b%E1%BB%8B-v%C5%A9-kh%C3%AD-si%C3%AAu-ch%E1%BA%A5t-%C4%90%E1%BB%93-ch%C6%A1i-L%E1%BA%AFp-gh%C3%A9p-Mini-Minifigures-Army-l%C3%ADnh-M%C3%B4-h%C3%ACnh-ww2-K7064-i.81322028.18212342323), Fortnite Pack (probably). Have a lot of weird stuff. ~~May buy 1 for the pan~~
    1. ~~2xM4 thingie; closest match is [M4 Pro Beardo](learn?key=brickarms#M4ProBeardo)'s scope.~~ [SK416](learn?key=minifigcat#SK416) and [M5](learn?key=minifigcat#M5)
    2. [XVR](learn?key=brickarms#XVR)
    3. 2x normal pistol, 1x generic-looking revolver
    4. A bunch of melee weaponry - crowbar, machete, pan etc.
    5. Grenade, gas mask, laptop & accessory belt 
12. [K7064B](https://shopee.vn/V%E1%BB%89-Ph%E1%BB%A5-ki%E1%BB%87n-trang-b%E1%BB%8B-v%C5%A9-kh%C3%AD-si%C3%AAu-ch%E1%BA%A5t-%C4%90%E1%BB%93-ch%C6%A1i-L%E1%BA%AFp-gh%C3%A9p-Mini-Minifigures-Army-l%C3%ADnh-M%C3%B4-h%C3%ACnh-ww2-K7064-i.81322028.18212342323), Mixed Pack
    1. 3x AK, two of which has holes which suggest customizable accessory
    2. SCAR, which also have holes.
    3. Something AR-looking; could be a G3 variant 
    4. AWM with bipod 
    5. 2x Scoped Rifle, need rechecking.
    6. MK46 
    7. Very plain looking rifle, normal bipod, recurve crossbow in 2-3 parts.

Included SVD with bipod (BrickArms' [AK-SV](learn?key=brickarms#AK-SV)), 6 AK with roughly different config, RPG-7, and a nightvision thingie.

11. K7071, See **PK-K7071** below as possible pack.

List later, ~~but most seems to be BrickArms variants~~ all seems to be mix-and-match version of existing BrickArms AKs. Biggest issue is the one labelled SVD, like fking hell it is.
13. [K7091](https://shopee.vn/V%E1%BB%89-Ph%E1%BB%A5-ki%E1%BB%87n-trang-b%E1%BB%8B-v%C5%A9-kh%C3%AD-si%C3%AAu-ch%E1%BA%A5t-%C4%90%E1%BB%93-ch%C6%A1i-L%E1%BA%AFp-gh%C3%A9p-Mini-Minifigures-Army-l%C3%ADnh-M%C3%B4-h%C3%ACnh-ww2-K7091-i.81322028.21649362609), ~~Dunno-what-is-the-goal pack.~~ Mixed stuff
    1. QBZ-95 with detachable knife-bayonet 
    2. QBU-88

    4. Accessory Pack (M4): 1xAK, 1xAK in SMG config (note the thin pistol-caliber mag), M249 variant, MGL-105. Mostly has accessory, like an axe, hatchet & walkie-talkie thingie.
