# Math

## Driest Definition

The highest abstraction of logic available to science. This is not necessarily a praise.

At the core, math seeks to emulate reality through extensive reasoning. In order to do so, it establishes and symbolizes existing concept (e.g number, shape, unit of degree etc.) as quantifiable `entities` and the logical basis of our observed reality as unprovable `axioms`. These two are the component from which all mathematical concepts derives.

Another important concept that is used extensively in math are `theorems`. A theorem is a statement that has or can be `proved`; but for the purpose of this essay, we only consider the proved ones. The proving of a theorem is the chain of reasoning that prove that the theorem is true, provided the chain does not have any fault, and all of the axioms used as the basis are valid. Once proven true, the theorem can be considered a quasi-axiom, in that it essentially function as one in any mathematical context. The main benefit of this is for us human to compress the proof of our theory into smaller, easier-to-digest bits to fit into our tiny little heads.

##### So what does it means for me?

Nothing. Logic is something you do whether you like it or not. And wherever logic goes, math follow. Learning math is the more extensive way to comprehend logic, and is the basis of all your progress in natural science. If you wish to use your brain in any appreciable capacity, you should learn as much math as you can.

##### But it hurts my head.

It's a good pain. Proof of your brain-muscle being worked.

##### Does learning math make me rich?

No. It only gives you the ego to look down even on the rich. Provided you learn it properly.

##### I don't believe you. I can do social science just fine without math.

A hedgehog is not a hog either.

##### What if any of the fundamental axioms in math are wrong?

Then we are in very deep trouble, because that implies either (1) we are collectively perceiving reality differently than it really is, or (2) logic (and thus reality) itself is unstable. So much trouble in fact that it's not really worth thinking about.

##### Right, so how do I learn it?
##### Yeah yeah whatever, let me out of here.

## Areas

Mathematics involves a variety of disciplines. The concerning ones in here are:
* [Arithmetic](learn&key=arithmetic), which primarily involve direct manipulation of numbers. Basic arithmetics only involves definition of [numbers](learn&key=number_set) and the [operations](learn&key=operations) to manipulate each. Higher arithmetics however stand shoulder-to-shoulder w.r.t complexity to all other fields, and contains many unsolved problems that are quite intriguing to just learn about.
* [Algebra](learn&key=algebra), **Bane of the common foolâ„¢**, is essentially an expansion pack for the above arithmetic, namely, with [variables](learn&key=variable) and [equations](learn&key=equation). In the same vein that theorem can form into quasi-axiom, `variables` are quasi-number (at the start) and `equations` are a representation of `theorems` in specialized format; this allowing a more compact representation of various conjectures with its many benefit (and some drawbacks e.g readability for layman, but who cares about those). Due to it being the first major abstraction in arithmetic-based mathematics, this is the main hurdle that kicked out most innumerate.
* [Calculus](learn&key=calculus), with its many ~~deadly~~ tempting concept such as [differentials](learn&key=differential), [derivatives](learb&key=derivatives), [integrals](learn&key=integral) and [infinitesimal](learn&key=infinitesimal), are, at the core, attempt to expand `variable` from its root as a fixed quasi-number into its own dynamic entity. The most popular example usually involves a car, its distance travelled *s* and its velocity *v*, with respect to the time *t*. In our earlier concepts, an equation such as \(s = v x t\) can only be correct if *v* is a static value; which in case of pesky reality, simply untrue. Thus, with a dynamic variable *v* that could have a specific value at each specific point of time; we construct this scary looking thing \(s = \rint^t v dv\) to better reflect the relationship - as in - the distance travelled *s* is the sum of all the effect velocity *v* do to it in the time *t*, be it travelling fast, travelling slow, backward, forward, or standing still. Or the alternative, \(v = s'\), reflecting that *v* is the rate that *s* change its value through the time *t*, which obviously is true *because that's the whole definition of velocity*.
* [Discrete](learn&key=discrete), which is contrary to those above, a downscaling of reach. Instead of expanding into a new frontier using past generalization (e.g we have a set of expressable-in-number integers Z, what is filled in the space between them? result of fraction (Q)? an infinite number of values which may or may not be expressable by a formula (Z)?), this simply focus on structures that are `discrete`, which is shorthand (and fancy) for stating that the entities in this structure are finite and constant. This allows for a more classical approach to exploring logic-based axioms, more mercenary theorems that could easier apply ad-hoc into real situations, and gave us funny things such as computer & `computer science`, `information theory`, `graph theory`, `algorithm complexity`, and more. 
* [Statistics](learn&key=statistics), which work with `probablity`, trade away the binary nature of a theorem/equation to be `correct` or `wrong` for more lax assumptions than axioms & theorems. This spectrum can and will be realized back into this binary nature at each occurence; but either the probability is working on a macro scale close enough to infinity that make this probablity comparable to real fraction (e.g radioactive decay), or it's only used as a suplement to draw not-necessarily true conjectures, so the reduced requirements grant it a greater application.
* [Geometry](learn&key=geometry) is the natural sibling of arithmetic; as arithmetic was born out of the need to count, geometry was born out of the need to measure. To accomplish this, again `entities` (such as `point`, `lines`, `angles` and `circle`) and `axioms` are created from which various theorems can again be verified. Being different expression of logic and reality, the two branchs naturally complement each other, drawing inspiration, theory, practice, and even cross-verify their own conclusion.
