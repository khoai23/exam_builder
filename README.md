All possible extension regard the builder, unlikely first:
- [ ] Procedurally generated problems (algebraic and geometric)
- [ ] Mouse-driven, or later touch-driven geometric drawer (drawing parallel line, same length, perpendicular, etc.)
- [x] Data source organized by category
- [x] Integrate the current game map into a game board
- [ ] Appropriate adjustable botting options
- [ ] Option to show relevant solution with wrong answers
- [ ] Drag-n-drop categorizer
- [ ] User management (add, delete, change roles etc.)

Remaining bugfix/missing features:
- [ ] Session expiration & archive 
- [ ] Button to flag possible duplicate items (remove or confirm as not-duplicate)
- [ ] Loading icon while performing modifying action e.g import/rollback 
- [ ] Commit-type import to prevent stupidity
- [ ] Shared & persistent last category, used for both Build & Modify
- [ ] Converter supporting doc file (only docx for now)
- [ ] Converter supporting multiple-choice question selection; exporting in the more generic xlsx instead.
- [ ] Converter direct import and copy content to clipboard (right now not working on Firefox)
- [ ] Import supporting xls file by xlrd
- [ ] Image support is only in solo mode; import image should support inline as default as well
- [x] Single manager capable of modifying settings (time limit, range, etc.)
- [ ] Single manager capable of modifying score composition & recalculate for all students
- [ ] Mechanism to notify and show appropriate logs when failure/wrong format etc. happens
- [ ] Game board invalid connection at edge; likely leftover from the extended 4-corner
- [ ] Occasional failure when creating a map (invalid polygon)
- [ ] Mechanism to do a test for increased coefficient of attacks and/or defense
