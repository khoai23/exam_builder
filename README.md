All possible extension regard the builder, unlikely first:
- [ ] Procedurally generated problems (algebraic and geometric)
- [ ] Mouse-driven, or later touch-driven geometric drawer (drawing parallel line, same length, perpendicular, etc.)
- [x] Template problems (replacing variables)
- [x] LaTeX-type formatting
- [ ] Data source
- [ ] Statistics for session managing (student weakness by tag)
- [ ] Authentication mechanism
- [x] Multiple-choice options

- [x] Filter for question category/tags
- [x] Redirect student with template key to a specializing page 
- [x] Converter from textfile variant into table variants

- [x] Add more info to session template (name, comment, expiry time, grace time, try to force submission upon end)
- [x] Image and/or graph support

Remaining bugfix/missing features:
- [ ] Session expiration & archive 
- [x] Manager panel to delete/kill sessions manually
- [x] Force submission when exam ends
- [x] Conditional variables for template problem (range, attributes e.g prime)
- [x] Table auto-scroll upon large screen
- [x] Import in append vs replace mode
- [ ] Finishing import should automatically reload the table
- [x] Text denoting import/export finished is not working
- [ ] Converter supporting doc file (only docx for now)
- [ ] Converter direct import and copy content to clipboard (right now not working on Firefox)
- [ ] Import supporting xls file by xlrd
- [ ] Allow rollback in case of crappy import 
- [x] CSV in utf-8 format cannot be read by Microsoft's Excel; likely requires full conversion to xlsx 
- [ ] Image support is only in solo mode; import image should support inline as default as well
