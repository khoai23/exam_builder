All possible extension regard the builder, unlikely first:
- [ ] Procedurally generated problems (algebraic and geometric)
- [ ] Mouse-driven, or later touch-driven geometric drawer (drawing parallel line, same length, perpendicular, etc.)
- [x] Template problems (replacing variables)
- [x] LaTeX-type formatting
- [ ] Data source
- [x] Statistics for session managing (student weakness by question category)
- [x] Import check for duplication
- [x] Split the current "build" page to "build", "edit" (for changing the data), and "table" (for generic display of the data)
- [ ] Option to show relevant solution with wrong answers
- [ ] Authentication mechanism
- [x] Multiple-choice options
- [ ] Drag-n-drop categorizer
- [x] Template usage for shared components (navigation bar, question table, etc)
- [x] Filter for question category/tags
- [x] Redirect student with template key to a specializing page 
- [x] Converter from textfile variant into table variants
- [x] Optional choice to use hashed info as student key (enabled by creator); choice to allow only specific key to enter (enabled by creator)
- [x] Add more info to session template (name, comment, expiry time, grace time, try to force submission upon end)
- [x] Image and/or graph support

Remaining bugfix/missing features:
- [ ] Session expiration & archive 
- [x] Manager panel to delete/kill sessions manually
- [x] Force submission when exam ends
- [x] Conditional variables for template problem (range, attributes e.g prime)
- [x] Table auto-scroll upon large screen
- [x] Import in append vs replace mode
- [x] Finishing import/rollback should automatically reload the table 
- [ ] Loading icon while performing modifying action e.g import/rollback 
- [ ] Commit-type import to prevent stupidity
- [x] Text denoting import/export finished is not working
- [ ] Converter supporting doc file (only docx for now)
- [ ] Converter direct import and copy content to clipboard (right now not working on Firefox)
- [ ] Import supporting xls file by xlrd
- [x] Allow rollback in case of crappy import 
- [x] CSV in utf-8 format cannot be read by Microsoft's Excel; likely requires full conversion to xlsx 
- [ ] Image support is only in solo mode; import image should support inline as default as well
- [x] Timer for each exam is hardcoded
- [x] Redirection for identify is still (relatively) busted
- [ ] Single manager capable of modifying settings (time limit, range, etc.)
- [x] Single manager can export list of student in excel format; should be in the format/order of the original list
- [ ] Student ID as key, which is not important considering the redirection 
- [x] Student showing correct answer and/or score if the option is enabled 
- [ ] Mechanism to auto-test exam generation, especially for single_equation/single_option variants
- [x] Mechanism to enforce rollback when import/deletion/whatever fail
- [ ] Mechanism to notify and show appropriate logs when failure/wrong format etc. happens
